# depressioncalculator
I have developed this model  which analyses whether the user is suffering from depression or not, based on the text that the enters. I have also deployed the model on the web interface for easier access. So i have used a dataset from kaggle that contains reddit users statements. so the model is developed using NLP and nltk techniques.
