# depressioncalculator
I have developed this model  which analyses whether the user is suffering from depression or not, based on the text that the enters. I have also deployed the model on the web interface for easier access. So i have used a dataset from kaggle that contains reddit users statements. so the model is developed using NLP and nltk techniques.

I have also delevoped the model, such that it replies according to the condition of the user, like it displays encouraging messages like "you are not alone in this" when the user is actually suffering from depression and "happy to hear it!" whnen the user is alright.
